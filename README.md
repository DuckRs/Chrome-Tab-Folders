# Chrome-Tab-Folders
This is an attempt at making a chrome extension that sorts your active tabs into folders.

Once the extension is loaded, you should see the extension's icon in the Chrome toolbar, and you can click it to open the extension's popup window. 
From there, you can click the "Sort Tabs" button to sort your tabs into folders.
